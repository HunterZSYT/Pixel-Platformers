Context Maintenance
To ensure I understand the context:

Detailed Descriptions: Always start with a brief recap or a description of where we left off, especially if a new session starts.

Documenting Progress: Use comments in the code or a separate document to track the current state of the project, planned features, and any issues. You can then share this document with me at the start of each session.

Versioning: Regularly commit changes to your GitHub repo with descriptive commit messages. This will not only help in tracking progress but also provide context if you share the commit history.

Important Notes: Always review the uploaded files to ensure everything is consistent and then provide me with appropriately named files: main_game.py and player.py. After every Updates do not change file names to different file
names.

v1. Pixel Platformer

main_game.py: The primary game script.
player.py: A module for player-related functionalities.
assets/: A directory for storing game assets.

updates : Imported the Player class from the player.py module.
Created a player object and added it to a sprite group.
Updated the game loop to handle key events, making the player move left or right based on arrow key presses.


v2. Pixel Platformer

Key Updates:

Added gravity to pull the player downwards.
Implemented a jump method that allows the player to jump.
Added a simple boundary condition to ensure the player doesn't fall off the screen. This will be enhanced later with actual platforms.

v3. 

Key Updates:
Platforms & Level Design: Add platforms that the player can stand on, jump between, and climb.
Winning Condition: Define a point or area that, when reached by the player, displays the "You Won!" message.
Obstacles: Introduce obstacles that the player must avoid or jump over.
created the platform.py module which defines a Platform class. For now, platforms are represented as brown rectangles.
mported the Platform class from the platform.py module.
Created several platforms and added them to the game environment.
Updated the game loop to handle player-platform collision detection, ensuring the player can stand on the platforms.
