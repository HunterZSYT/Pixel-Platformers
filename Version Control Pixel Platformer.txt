Context Maintenance
To ensure I understand the context:

Detailed Descriptions: Always start with a brief recap or a description of where we left off, especially if a new session starts.

Documenting Progress: Use comments in the code or a separate document to track the current state of the project, planned features, and any issues. You can then share this document with me at the start of each session.

Versioning: Regularly commit changes to your GitHub repo with descriptive commit messages. This will not only help in tracking progress but also provide context if you share the commit history.


v1. Pixel Platformer

main_game.py: The primary game script.
player.py: A module for player-related functionalities.
assets/: A directory for storing game assets.

updates : Imported the Player class from the player.py module.
Created a player object and added it to a sprite group.
Updated the game loop to handle key events, making the player move left or right based on arrow key presses.


v2. Pixel Platformer

Key Updates:

Added gravity to pull the player downwards.
Implemented a jump method that allows the player to jump.
Added a simple boundary condition to ensure the player doesn't fall off the screen. This will be enhanced later with actual platforms.

Updates: Integrated the jump method to allow the player to jump using the UP arrow key.
